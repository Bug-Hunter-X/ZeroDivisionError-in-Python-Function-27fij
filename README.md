This repository demonstrates a common Python error: ZeroDivisionError. The `bug.py` file contains code that will raise this exception when executed.  The `bugSolution.py` provides a solution to handle this error gracefully.

**To reproduce the error:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.py` using a Python interpreter.  You will see a traceback indicating the ZeroDivisionError.

**Solution:**
The `bugSolution.py` demonstrates how to use exception handling (a try-except block) to prevent the program from crashing when a division by zero occurs.
